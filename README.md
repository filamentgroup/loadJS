## Usage

Place the [`loadJS` function](https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadJS/blob/master/loadJS.js) inline in the `head` of your page (it can also be included in an external JavaScript file if preferable).

Then call it by passing it a JavaScript URL:

```html
<head>
…
  <script>
    // include loadJS here…
    function loadJS( src ) { … }
    // load a file with loadJS
    loadJS( "path/to/script.js" );
  </script>
…
</head>
```

You can execute code after the Script has loaded via a callback:

```html
<head>
…
  <script>
    // include loadJS here…
    function loadJS( src ) { … }
    // load a file with loadJS
    loadJS( "path/to/script.js", function() {
      // file has loaded
    });
  </script>
…
</head>
```

## Why not use `<script src="…" async defer>`?

The `async` and `defer` attributes enjoy broad browser support. They're great options when all you need to do is load a script for all users, ideally in a non-blocking manner. The limitations with these attributes are:

1. Some older browsers do not support `async` ([though `defer` has broader support so it's typically not a problem](https://www.igvita.com/2014/05/20/script-injected-async-scripts-considered-harmful/)).
2. There's no way to use these attributes to *conditionally* load a script, depending on feature or environmental conditions.

Number 2 above is the main reason we use `loadJS`. Say you want to check if `querySelector` is supported before requesting your entire DOM framework and UI scripting—you'll need to use a script loader to do that. But again, if you just want to load a script unconditionally, these attributes are recommended.

## Limitations

`loadJS` does nothing to manage execution order of requested scripts, so we do not advise using it to load multiple javascript files that depend on one another. It simply fetches a script and executes it as soon as possible. You can certainly use `loadJS` to load multiple scripts as long as those scripts are designed to execute independently of any other scripts being loaded by `loadJS`.

## Contributions and Bug Fixes

Both are very much appreciated—especially bug fixes. As for contributions, this project's goals are to keep things very simple and utilitarian, so if we don't accept a feature addition, it's not necessarily because it's a bad idea. It just may not meet the goals of the project. Thanks!
